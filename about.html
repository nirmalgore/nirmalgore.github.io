**In brief**
		I am a finance professional at heart. I have a strong written communication skills. I love to express myself by writing articles on current topics in economy. I am the editor of the finance magazine of our MBA college. I have been shortlisted for the UPSC interview of a civil service examination (CAPF). I have scored more marks than AIR 1 in the Civil Service (Main) Examination, 2016. My areas of interest lie in the field of finance and development economics. 

**Background**
		I belong to the city of Aurangabad. It is the tourist capital of Maharashtra, India. We host the two world famous site of Ajanta caves and Ellora caves. And around 15 kms from these caves is my school Kendriya Vidyalaya, Aurangabad. My core personal and professional values of inclusion and tolerance were inculcated in me by this school. I was part of Bharat Scout & Guides during my school days. I have received the 2nd highest award for a boy scout called the *Rajya Puraskar*. 
		
		Doing something different and standing out from the herd has been a key driving force in my life. After I finished my school I decided to take the "road less travelled". Hence, contrary to the popular choice I chose commerce over engineering.
		
		To expose myself to a new learning atmosphere I shifted to Pune and got admission in the Brihan Maharashtra College of Commmerce (BMCC), Pune. During my graduation I had the opportunity to assist my faculty on a research paper. The research paper was presented at an international conference hosted by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Singapore in the year 2012. My graduation years gave me a expanded my perspective in life and I decided to pursue a career in Civil Service Examination.
		
		My journey of Civil Service Examination was a journey of self-discovery as much as it was about becoming a civil servant. The half-a-decade long journey shaped my world view, it shaped my thoughts and opinions. It gave me the courage to accept failures and learn from them. It has entrusted me with both tangible and intangible skills. I have developed an ability to look at the bigger picture. I can now understand the intricacies of economics like never before. I have realised that economics is much more than just the forces of demand and supply.
