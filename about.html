	<p><strong>In brief</strong></p>
	<p>I am a finance professional at heart. 
		I have strong written communication skills. I love to express myself by writing articles on current issues on economy. 
		I am the editor of the finance magazine of our college. I have been shortlisted for the UPSC interview of a civil service examination (CAPF). 
		I have scored more marks than All India Rank 1 in the Civil Service (Main) Examination, 2016. My areas of interest lie in the field of 
		finance and development economics. 
	</p>
	
	<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
	<p>I belong to the city of Aurangabad. It is the tourist capital of Maharashtra, India. 
		We host two world heritage sites Ajanta caves and Ellora caves. And around 15 kms from these caves is my school Kendriya Vidyalaya, Aurangabad. 
		My core personal and professional values of inclusion and tolerance were inculcated in me by this school. I was part of Bharat Scout & Guides (Boy Scout) 
		during my school days. I have received the 2nd highest award for a boy scout in India called the <em>Rajya Puraskar</em>.
	</p>
	
	<p>Doing something different and standing out from the herd has been a key driving force in my life. After I finished my school I decided to take 
		the "road less travelled". So, contrary to the popular choice I chose commerce over engineering. To expose myself to a new learning atmosphere 
		I shifted to Pune and got admission in the Brihan Maharashtra College of Commmerce (BMCC), Pune. During my graduation I had the opportunity to 
		assist my faculty on a research paper. The research paper was presented at an international conference hosted by the 
		World Health Organisation (WHO) in Singapore in the year 2012. My graduation years expanded my perspective in life and I decided 
		to pursue a career in Civil Service Examination.
	</p>
	
	<p>My journey of Civil Service Examination was a journey of self-discovery as much as it was about becoming a civil servant. 
		The half-a-decade long journey shaped my world view, it shaped my thoughts and opinions. It gave me the courage to accept failures and learn 
		from them. It has entrusted me with both tangible and intangible skills. I have developed an ability to look at the bigger picture. 
		I can now understand the intricacies of economics like never before. I have realised that economics is much more than just the forces of 
		demand and supply.
		
		In the year 2017 I decided to pursue a masters course. This is because I honestly believe that pursuing a masters transforms you as a person. It improves your understanding of the complicated nature of your subject. However, it also did something more to me, I got more clarity on my understanding of our world and I became more mature at decision making.
	</p>

	<p>That's about me. We can meet in person and this conversation can be even more interesting.</p>
