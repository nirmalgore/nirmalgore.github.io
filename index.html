	<p>There are two ideas that fascinate me the most. Our world today is faced with plethora of problems. 
		The pressing ones are inequality, hunger, climate change and many more. So, I am trying to do my bit to solve these problems. 
		This is the first idea. </p>

	</p>The second one about creating the future. 
	The idea of <em>Industrial Revolution 4.0</em> is about the way technologies, like artificial intelligence, machine learning and others, 
	are going to create a disruption in the way human beings live in this world. I am very passionate about ideas and projects that work to 
	create a better future for the mankind.</p>
