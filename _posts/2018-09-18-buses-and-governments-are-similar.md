Here is an analogy of buses and governments. And its not for the weak of hearts. 

I was travelling on a bus from Bengaluru to Pune. The scheduled arrival (manifestos of political parties) for Pune was 11 AM. However, the bus was travelling at a very slow speed (economy, eh?), which meant we were still halfway from Pune (promises vs reality) at 8 AM. I asked the bus driver (well, you cannot do that to the driver of your economy i.e. our PM) when will we reach Pune, and he said, '' in 3 more hours.'' I believed him because I had trust in the travel company to which he belonged which was SRS travels (BJP/INC) and the user reviews (elections in Gujrat) on Redbus were also terrific. 

After asking this question he must have envisioned the series of questions he might have to answer when other passengers, like me, realize that the bus is not going to arrive at the destination at the scheduled time. So, he did something very interesting. He asked his subordinate (ultra-right-wing outfits and electronic media) to switch on the TV and play the most interesting movie, Dangal (Politics of Hindu-Muslim, Caste, and Jingoism). Now here is the tricky part. 

You like movies, not necessarily this one, but the movie is a movie, it acts like a drug and you start to lose consciousness of your surroundings. The effect of the movie is enhanced because the TV is kept right in front of your eyes which diminishes the possibility of you turning your back to it (electronic media increases the loudness of these incidents by serving us these toxic dishes from morning till evening and we have nowhere to go). 

The driver was trying to play with your weak spot (One religion/caste feels its existence is threatened by another religion/caste). He switched on the TV to divert our attention from the delay caused by the bus (fundamental issues of unemployment, corruption, poverty) and tried to avoid a possible unleashing of rage (difficult questions) by the fellow passengers which would have made him answer difficult questions. And obviously, he was successful in suppressing the possible dissent. Everyone reached the destination safely(India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the World). Well, safe here does not mean everything was hail and hearty because this delay in arrival hurt people (Hunger, Poverty, Unemployment). One notable injury was this, my co-passenger missed his joining date of Infosys.
