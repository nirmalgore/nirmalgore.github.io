  November 8, 2017, marked one year of Mr Trump's election as the 45th President of America and Mr Modi has also completed half of his current term as the Prime Minister of India. Numerous articles have been written on the comparison between the two political leaders. I wish to put forth my perspective on the same. The intention of this exercise is to quench my thirst for some creative exploration of ideas.
   I have a keen interest in understanding the dynamics of the world. I am very curious about the way the world works. I am on a journey to understand how major players of world politics try to influence our lives on earth. This journey has led me to read as much as possible on global politics and world history. With the same spirit, I have followed the 45th Presidential elections of the USA and the 16th Lok Sabha elections in India. During this period of time, I have encountered certain similarities between Mr Modi and Mr Trump. I would like to enlist them in this article.
  For starters: the main political opponent of Mr Narendra Modi (a candidate from Bharatiya Janata Party) was Mr Rahul Gandhi from the Indian National Congress. And the main political opponent for Mr Donald Trump (Republican) was Ms Hillary Clinton (Democrat).

### Anti-incumbency/Anti-establishment

  One of the main political points scored by both the political leaders is on account of being outsiders. Neither of them belonged to any political family. 
  Unlike Mr Rahul Gandhi, Mr Modi pitched himself as the one who does not belong to any political dynasty.  He said that INC and the Gandhi family (Nehru-Gandhi Family) were two of the main reasons why India had not been able to realise it's true potential since independence. Similarly, Mr Trump also pitched himself as an outsider. He said that it is actually Mr Bill Clinton who is seeking another term at the White House in the name of Ms Hillary Clinton and said that he will repeat the same mistakes he committed the last time.
   Both the leaders were running against an incumbent government. In the case of Mr Modi, it was the UPA-II (United Progressive Alliance) which was running for its 2nd term. Whereas, Mr Trump was running against the Democratic party which was running for its third consecutive term. Both the leaders held the incumbent governments responsible for two things; the pathetic state of the respective economies and complete lack of efficiency on the jobs front.
   Mr Modi blamed the UPA for the miserable condition of Indian economy and held the UPA responsible for being a harbinger of scams in India. A picture was painted of Mr Modi as the one who does not have any immediate family, unlike Mr Gandhi, and 'hence' he might not have any interest in consolidation of personal wealth. This argument was significant on the backdrop of numerous corruption scams unearthed during the UPA-II rule (2009-14). He criticised the UPA for not creating enough jobs for the Indian youth. 
   On similar lines, Mr Trump blamed the Obama administration for the pitiable state of the US economy. He also criticised the administration for not creating enough jobs. He criticised the administration for not doing enough about the loss of American jobs in the name of "offshoring of work".  He said that, unlike Ms Clinton, funding his own campaign saves him from being at the mercy of donors. He asserted that Ms Clinton would succumb to the demands of her donors and hence the US economy would work on the whims and fancies of the Clinton campaign contributors.

### Criticism of dynasty politics

The five most common ways to value a business are

* asset valuation,
* historical earnings valuation,
* future maintainable earnings valuation,
* relative valuation (comparable company and comparable transactions),
* discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation

Professionals who value businesses generally do not use just one of these methods but a combination of some of them, as well as possibly others that are not mentioned above, in order to obtain a more accurate value. The information in the balance sheet or income statement is obtained by one of three accounting measures: a Notice to Reader, a Review Engagement or an Audit.

As synergy plays a large role in the valuation of acquisitions, it is paramount to get the value of synergies right. Synergies are different from the "sales price" valuation of the firm, as they will accrue to the buyer. Hence, the analysis should be done from the acquiring firm's point of view. Synergy-creating investments are started by the choice of the acquirer, and therefore they are not obligatory, making them essentially real options. To include this real options aspect into analysis of acquisition targets is one interesting issue that has been studied lately.
